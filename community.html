			<h2>What is Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
			<p>Released around 1977 and 1979. Game rules were reorganized and re-codified across three hardcover rulebooks, compiled by Gary Gygax, incorporating the original D&D rules and many additions and revisions from supplements and magazine articles. It had three core rulebooks The Monster Manual (1977), the Player's Handbook (1978), and the Dungeon Master's Guide (1979). Major additions included classes from supplements like assassin, druid, monk, paladin, and thief, while bard, illusionist, and ranger, which had previously only appeared in magazine articles, were added to the core rulebooks. An alignment system with nine alignments was used, rather than the previous three-alignment system in the original D&D rules.

			<h2>What is the story to Dark Sun: Shattered Lands</h2>
			<p>Shattered Lands; a game about slavery, freedom, and unification. You start off as a group of adventurers who get caught by slavers. The fate of a slave is usually not that pretty in the world of Dark Sun. Thus, your fate is sealed for certain doom. Left with little option, your group is forced to fight as gladiators in an arena of death. However, certain doom can be avoided, if you choose to fight for it. Indeed freedom is only gained in this world through steel and clenched fist. Upon escaping and earning freedom, you happen upon a dead body with a message - the Sorcerer King is amassing a massive army. You do what any hero would do in such a situation. You warn the local villages, and begin the aurdious process of uniting the outskirts against the impending threat. And thus begins your great journey!

			<h2>What is Age of Decadence</h2>
			<div>
				<p>The Age of Decadence is a turn-based, hardcore role-playing game set in a low magic, post-apocalyptic fantasy world. The game features a detailed skill-based character system, multiple skill-based ways to handle quests, choices & consequences, and extensive dialogue trees.</p>
				<div><img src="pictures/age.jpg" class="agepicture"></div>
			</div>
			<h2>What is the story of Age of Decadence</h2>
			<div>
				<p>The Age of Decadence is not a game about killing monsters or exploring mystical lands, but rather, surviving amid the greed and brutality of your fellow humans and carving out a name for yourself. Good and bad are purely relative. It’s a world of scheming and backstabbing in which your words and actions have the potential to forge alliances and sow discord, and your path is never certain. 
				<p>You get to play with seven different factions: three Noble Houses and four 'professional' guilds: merchants, assassins, thieves, and the army, all fighting for power or influence; over 100 named characters, over 750 ‘generic’ characters with unique IDs taking part in violent take-overs, assassinations, and power grabs, and over 600,000 words of dialogue: a well-developed and thought through world, believable characters, realistic motivations, but no elves, dwarves, magic, and wizards in fashionable, pointy hats.</p>

			<h2>What is D&D 5E</h2>
			<p>Fifth Edition is comparatively a more streamlined edition compared to the other entries. Not necessarily dumbed down. However, a lot of the jagged edges and needlessly complicated elements have been toned down. According to D&D Lead Designer Mike Mearls a lot of rules decisions came down to driving the action to the table rather than to the books. Meaning cutting down on rules that required brute force memorization. Essentially serving to be a better place for newcomers to start in.</p>

			<h2>What is Neverwinter Nights</h2>
			<p>Neverwinter Nights is an adaptation of the D&D 3.5 ruleset to a 3D video format released in June 2003. Its engine, the Aurora engine, was designed so that anyone who could learn the toolset could make their own campaigns and share them with others. The original campaign takes place in the Forgotten Realms setting in the countryside around Neverwinter. Neverwinter Nights 2 is an indirect sequel to Neverwinter Nights made by Obsidian entertainment release in 2006. It runs off a modified version of the Aurora engine that had a more complicated toolset. As such its community made campaigns are sparse compared to Neverwinter Night's community campaigns. It has three official campaigns.</p>

			<h2>What is D&D 3.5E</h2>
			<p>In July 2003, a revised version of the 3rd edition D&D rules (termed v. 3.5) was released that incorporated numerous small rule changes, as well as expanding the Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual. This revision was intentionally a small one focusing on addressing common complaints about certain aspects of gameplay, hence the "half edition" version number. The basic rules are fundamentally the same, only differing in balancing. Many monsters and items are compatible (or even unchanged) between those editions. New spells are added, and numerous changes are made to existing spells, while some spells are removed from the updated Player's Handbook. New feats are added and numerous changes are made to existing feats, while several skills are renamed or merged with other skills.</p>

			<p>Pillars of Eternity is a series of role-playing games that features a party-based real-time-with-pause tactical gameplay, fixed isometric user interface for the game-world with two-dimensional pre-rendered backdrops, in a similar vein as its spiritual predecessors Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale series and Planescape: Torment. The games do not reward experience points for killing enemies, only for completing quests and discovering new areas. This means that non-violent approaches such as stealth are just as rewarding. It uses its own custom rule set, unlike most cRPGs.</p>

This revision was intentionally a small one focusing on addressing common complaints about certain aspects of gameplay, hence the "half edition" version number. The basic rules are fundamentally the same, only differing in balancing. Many monsters and items are compatible (or even unchanged) between those editions. New spells are added, and numerous changes are made to existing spells, while some spells are removed from the updated Player's Handbook. New feats are added and numerous changes are made to existing feats, while several skills are renamed or merged with other skills.</p>

			<p>Create your very own party of adventurers with our Character Creation Tool in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. Delve into long forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts. Fight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over - on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground. The game uses the D&D 5E ruleset.</p>
			<h2>What is D&D 5E</h2>
			<p>Fifth Edition is comparatively a more streamlined edition compared to the other entries. Not necessarily dumbed down. However, a lot of the jagged edges and needlessly complicated elements have been toned down. According to D&D Lead Designer Mike Mearls a lot of rules decisions came down to driving the action to the table rather than to the books. Meaning cutting down on rules that required brute force memorization. Essentially serving to be a better place for newcomers to start in.</p>

			<h2>What is Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</h2>
			<p>Knights of the Old Republic is the first computer RPG set in the Star Wars universe. It uses the d20 System, from the Wizards of the Coast Star Wars Roleplaying Game rules. The game also allows the player to either be a servant to the light side of the Force or the dark side, using an alignment system that tracks actions, from simple dialogue choices to major plot decisions. Combat is turn-based. Time is divided into discrete rounds, and combatants attack/react simultaneously. However, the number of actions a combatant may perform each round is limited. While the round's duration is a fixed short interval of real time (around six seconds), the player can configure the combat system to pause at specific events or at the end of each round. In total there about two games.</p>

			<h2>What is D20</h2>
			<p>The d20 System is a role-playing game system published in 2000 by Wizards of the Coast, originally developed for the third edition of Dungeons & Dragons. The system is named after the 20-sided dice which are central to the core mechanics of many actions in the game. Much of the d20 System was released as the System Reference Document (SRD) under the Open Game License (OGL) as Open Game Content (OGC), which allows commercial and non-commercial publishers to release modifications or supplements to the system without paying for the use of the system's associated intellectual property, which is owned by Wizards of the Coast.
